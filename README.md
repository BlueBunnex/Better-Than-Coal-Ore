# Shivering Hills
A larger mod project.
    
## All features

- always winter
- mana/magic system; unlock spellbooks as you progress
- revised worldgen; taller mountains; more biomes
- new mobs (mostly enemies)
- final boss (end goal)
- temperature system; warm (heal slowly), cold, freezing (take damage)

silver: a metal capable of being imbued with magic?

### Spellbooks
- **Rot**: turns a log into a rotted log, making it soft enough to break
- **Blood Control**: temporarily stun an enemy

## Progression

### Early game
Start game with only one spellbook, rot; Use it to break a log to make an axe to actually mine. First milestone (besides getting food to survive) is crafting your first book, which can be turned into a spellbook.

### Mid game

### End game
Final boss: Dark Knight, very hard, wither-like spawning
