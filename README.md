# Better Than Coal Ore

> [!WARNING]
> I need to change the project title

- Challenge Mod for b1.7.3 with an actual end goal
- adds dark knights to the nether that guard a structure that contains an item you need to summon the final boss
- and it's forced hardcore
- sand and dirt now drop sand and dirt piles, and a chance of a rock (sand's chance is higher)
