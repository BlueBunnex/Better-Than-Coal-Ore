# Better Than Coal Ore [StationAPI]
**Better Than Coal Ore** (BTCO) is a challenge Mod for b1.7.3 with an actual end goal.

# TODO
- sand and dirt now drop sand and dirt piles, and a chance of a rock (sand's chance is higher)

## Plan
- adds dark knights to the nether that guard a structure that contains an item you need to summon the final boss
- and it's forced hardcore
- iron doesn't spawn on the surface
