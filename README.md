# Better Than Coal Ore [StationAPI]
**Better Than Coal Ore** (BTCO) is a challenge Mod for b1.7.3 with an actual end goal.

# Added
- **Sand, gravel, and dirt** now drop **sand, gravel, and dirt piles**
  - **Sand and dirt** have a small chance of dropping a **rock**
  - **Gravel** has a small chance of dropping **flint**

# TODO
- rock + flint + leather = Flintknapping
- 4 rock = cobblestone
- 4 pile = corresponding block

## Plan
- neither wood nor stone tools exist, you have to start at... copper?
- adds dark knights to the nether that guard a structure that contains an item you need to summon the final boss
- and it's forced hardcore
- iron doesn't spawn on the surface
