- revised worldgen; taller mountains; new biomes; always winter
- new mobs (mostly enemies)

silver: a metal capable of being imbued with magic?

### Temperature system
**Stages:**
- Warm (heal slowly)
- Normal
- Cold
- Freezing (take damage)

During the day, you will never drop past "cold" unless you are in water or at very high altitudes.

During the night, you will begin to freeze unless near a heat source.

### Hunger system
Unlike modern hunger, being full does NOT mean you heal (healing only occurs when warm). Instead, hunger is
simply another system that can kill you if not attended to.

**Stages:**
- Normal
- Peckish
- Hungry
- Starving (take damage)

### Spellbooks
- **Rot**: turns a log into a rotted log, making it soft enough to break
- **Blood Control**: temporarily stun an enemy

## Progression

### Early game
Start game with only one spellbook, rot; Use it to break a log to make an axe to actually mine. First milestone (besides getting food to survive) is crafting your first book, which can be turned into a spellbook.

### Mid game

### End game
Final boss: Dark Knight, very hard, wither-like spawning
