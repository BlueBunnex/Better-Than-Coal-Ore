### Temperature system
**Stages:**
- **Warm** (heal slowly)
- **Normal**
- **Cold**
- **Freezing** (take damage)

As long as you are in light, you will never drop past "cold" (unless you are in water or at very high altitudes).
In the dark (such as at night or in a cave), you will begin to freeze unless near a heat source. In order to heal,
you must be warm, which requires you stand next to a **strong heat source** (not just be in light).

**Strong heat sources:**
- **Lava**: In the early game, standing next to lava is the only way you will be able to heal because you won't be able to craft better heat sources until later.

### Hunger system
Unlike modern hunger, being full does NOT mean you heal (healing only occurs when warm). Instead, hunger is
simply another system that can kill you if not attended to.

**Stages:**
- **Normal**
- **Peckish**
- **Hungry**
- **Starving** (take damage)

### Spellbooks
- **Rot**: turns a log into a rotted log, making it soft enough to break
- **Blood Control**: temporarily stun an enemy

## Progression

### Early game
Start game with only one spellbook, rot; Use it to break a log to make tools. You must find a light source before
nightfall or you will freeze; Either lava or coal for a torch will work. However, you will starve before daybreak* if
you don't also find food at the same time.

*I may make starvation take longer/be more forgiving.

### Mid game
You enter the mid game after crafting your first book, which can be turned into a spellbook.

### End game
Preparation for defeating the final boss: Dark Knight (very hard; wither-like spawning).
